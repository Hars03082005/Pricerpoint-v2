# PricerPoint v2.4 — Dealership ML Valuation System

> **Scope:** Dealership / manager internal portal only.  
> Seller portal · Buyer portal · Computer vision — all on hold.

PricerPoint automates used-car acquisition decisions for dealerships. A dealer enters vehicle details, the system predicts the market value using an ML ensemble, applies a condition calibration, runs a rule-based dealer decision engine, and returns a complete acquisition recommendation — buy price, sell price, profit, risk score, and BUY / NEGOTIATE / REJECT action — in under a second.

## 1. Problem Statement

Used-car dealerships must quote a competitive acquisition price the moment a seller walks in. The manual process — market lookup, negotiation experience, rough estimation — is slow, inconsistent, and risky. A competing dealership can win the deal simply by quoting faster.

PricerPoint solves this by:
- Predicting market value from vehicle features using a trained ML ensemble
- Routing predictions to price-bracket-specific models for accuracy
- Generating a complete dealer decision (price, profit, risk, action) instantly

## 2. How It Works

```
Dealer enters vehicle details
        ↓
FastAPI backend receives request
        ↓
get_segment() routes to correct price bracket model
    Budget (≤₹5L)   → Global ensemble  (MAPE 11.93%)
    Mid    (₹5–15L) → Mid segment model (MAPE  8.64%)
    Premium (₹15L+) → Premium segment model (MAPE 9.18%)
        ↓
Base market value predicted (log1p → expm1)
        ↓
Condition multiplier applied (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor)
        ↓
Dealer decision engine calculates:
    - Recommended buy price
    - Recommended sell price
    - Expected profit
    - Risk score / Confidence score / Deal quality
    - Negotiation trio (opening / target / walk-away)
    - BUY / NEGOTIATE / REJECT action
        ↓
Response returned to React frontend
```

## 5. ML Pipeline — v2.4

### Dataset
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Source | `ml_training/data/cars.csv` |
| Raw rows | 36,956 |
| Clean rows | 36,439 |
| OEM brands | 46 |
| Price range (clean) | ₹50,343 – ₹9.55 Cr |

### Features Used (14)
| Feature | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `brand` | Categorical | OEM name |
| `model` | Categorical | Model name |
| `variant` | Categorical | Trim/variant level |
| `vehicle_age` | Numeric | `2026 - year` |
| `fuel_type` | Categorical | Petrol/Diesel/CNG/Electric |
| `transmission` | Categorical | Manual/Automatic |
| `odometer_reading` | Numeric | km driven |
| `fuel_efficiency` | Numeric | km/L (median-imputed) |
| `owner_count` | Numeric | Number of previous owners |
| `engine_cc` | Numeric | Engine displacement |
| `city` | Categorical | Listing city |
| `km_per_year` | Numeric | `odometer / max(age, 1)` |
| `ownership_trust_score` | Numeric | 100→25 by owner count |
| `vehicle_health_score` | Numeric | `100 - age×3 - km/10000 - (owners-1)×8` |

### Training Split
```
Total: 36,439 rows
  ├── Train:      70%  (~25,507 rows)
  ├── Validation: 15%  (~5,466 rows)  ← ensemble weight optimisation
  └── Test:       15%  (~5,466 rows)  ← final unbiased metrics
```

### Ensemble Strategy
- Three base learners trained independently: CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost
- Ensemble weights optimised on the validation set using SLSQP (maximise R²)
- Final prediction: `w_cb × pred_cb + w_lgb × pred_lgb + w_xgb × pred_xgb`
- Target transform: `log1p(selling_price)` → `expm1()` at inference

### Condition Calibration (post-ML)
Applied after ensemble prediction to enforce monotonicity:
| Condition | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Excellent | 1.035 |
| Good | 1.000 |
| Average | 0.940 |
| Poor | 0.860 |

---

## 6. Model Performance

### Global Ensemble (all price ranges, legacy fallback)
| Split | R² | MAE | RMSE | MAPE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Train | 0.9504 | ₹73,429 | ₹1,62,674 | 10.37% |
| Validation | 0.9364 | ₹86,145 | ₹1,93,193 | 11.84% |
| **Test** | **0.9312** | **₹84,531** | **₹1,94,993** | **11.93%** |

**Overfitting gap:** 0.014 → `healthy_generalization` ✅

### Ensemble Weights (Global)
| Model | Weight |
|---|---|
| LightGBM | 85.5% |
| CatBoost | 9.5% |
| XGBoost | 5.1% |

---

## 7. Segmented Models

Three separate ensembles trained per price bracket (v2.3):

| Segment | Price Range | Rows | MAPE | MAE | R² | Active? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Budget** | ₹0 – ₹5L | 17,340 | 13.39% | ₹35,699 | 0.8385 | ❌ bypassed (global is better) |
| **Mid** | ₹5L – ₹15L | 15,356 | **8.64%** | ₹72,364 | 0.8275 | ✅ |
| **Premium** | ₹15L+ | 3,664 | **9.18%** | ₹2,50,013 | 0.8503 | ✅ |

### Routing Logic
```python
seller_asking_price == 0      → mid  (default)
seller_asking_price <= 500k   → budget → routed to GLOBAL (more accurate)
seller_asking_price <= 1.5M   → mid segment model
seller_asking_price >  1.5M   → premium segment model
```

API response includes:
```json
{
  "price_segment": "mid",
  "segment_model_used": true,
  "routing_note": "mid segment model used"
}
```

  "urgency_score": 65,
  "action": "BUY",
  "shap": [...],
  "warnings": []
}
```

---

## 9. Decision Engine Formula

```
Final Market Value   = Base ML Value × Condition Multiplier
Target Profit        = Market Value × target_margin_pct %
Holding Cost         = Market Value × 2.5%
Risk Buffer          = Market Value × (risk_score / 100) × 8%
Recommended Buy      = Market Value − Target Profit − Repair Buffer − Holding Cost − Risk Buffer
Recommended Sell     = Market Value × 1.05
Expected Profit      = Recommended Sell − Recommended Buy − Repair Buffer − Holding Cost

Action thresholds:
  BUY        → confidence ≥ 65 AND risk < 55
  NEGOTIATE  → confidence 50–64 OR risk 55–74
  REJECT     → confidence < 50 OR risk ≥ 75
```

## 13. Known Issues & Next Improvements

### 🟡 Medium
- Physical features (`Seats`, `No of Cylinder`, `power_to_weight_ratio`) exist in `cleaned.csv` but are not yet in `FEATURES` — adding them would improve budget MAPE
- `km_per_year` is uncapped — `car_age = 0` inflates this feature to the raw odometer value
- `training_report.json` and `model_metadata.json` are identical writes in the training script — one can be removed to avoid duplication (training_report.json is already gitignored)

### 🟢 Low
- Add `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')` at the top of the training script so it works on Windows without the `PYTHONUTF8=1` env var
- Add model versioning (timestamp suffix on artifacts) so retrains don't silently overwrite previous metrics
